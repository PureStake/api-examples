Code samples for PureStake's API-As-A-Service

PureStake provides access to the Algorand TestNet and MainNet Ledgers over REST API. Signups are free.

The ledgers available are complete, indexed, and in a redundant, load balanced configuration under close monitoring.  

There are some requirements for using the PureStake API, and only the JavaScript SDK and GO SDK published by Algorand are fully supported today.  

The Python SDK may be used, with modifications to the underlying library until a PR for support of multiple headers is accepted.  

## Example using Algorand JavaScript SDK

* [GET ledger version](javascript-examples/get_versions.js)
* [POST transaction](javascript-examples/submit_tx.js)
* [GET Transaction By ID](javascript-examples/get_tx.js)
